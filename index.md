I'm a thorough-bred Bengali, brought up in Kolkata and Pune and currently living in Chennai. I passed my ICSE 10th std from Pawar Public School, Pune. I did my CBSE 11th & 12th std from City International School, Pune and ended up as one of the city toppers with 97.2% marks in my boards. Right now I'm an undergrad student of *Electronics Engineering* at **IIITD&M Kancheepuram**.
                  
I have been into coding since 9th std and started with Front-End Web Development during my 1st year of college. Now I'm in my 2nd year and am working as a Front-End Developer at [*Digital Media Team, IIITD&M Kancheepuram*](https://github.com/DMT-IIITDM). Till date I'm proficient *Java, C, C++, HTML & CSS* and am learning *Javascript* and *Python*.
                  
Besides engineering and coding, I've always been a dance enthusiast. I briefly trained as an Odissi dancer and have always been in touch with it. Dancing is an indispensable part of my life. I have been a part of multiple semi-classical and contemporary dance teams till date. Currently, I'm a co-ordinator and member of our college dance troupe, *Footlights*.
                  
I'm quite a bookworm. I love the works of *Rabindranath Tagore, Jane Austen, Dan Brown* and *JK Rowling*. I enjoy singing and listening to music. Also, I watch loads of movies. Usually, they range from Hollywood to all time Bengali classics as well as more contemporary ones.

I am fluent in Bengali, Hindi and English and can manage a regular conversation in Marathi. My goal is to at least master speaking in Tamil by the time I complete college!
